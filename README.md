# DevOps-VersionControlWithGit-Playground
This is a repository for the third lection of SoftUni course - DevOps about Version Control with Git. I made this repository just to train different Git commands and to see how merge and pull requests work. I was just practising branches, issues, pull requests and other thing related with Git.
